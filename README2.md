* a paragraph or two about what you find interesting about that article:
    + My friend shared this article with me a while back that introduced me to an issue I'd never thought of before-- I recommend it to anyone passionate about Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), and intersectionality in the tech industry. In the North American context, it's a good reminder not to lump minorities and overlook the privileges or prejudice within their communities-- I found the article thought-provoking and relevant to other DEI issues.
